            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              If you're a developer—or even just someone building a website for your business—you've probably asked yourself this at some point:
              Should I go with a CMS (Content Management System) or build the site from scratch with custom code?
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              It's also one of the most common questions we get from clients at Tech Lumina. So, let's break it down in a way that's easy to understand. 
              To keep things simple, we'll use a bakery as an example and look at the key things you should consider before making your decision.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">🧁 1. Scalability: How Big Are You Planning to Grow?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Say you've got a small, cozy bakery with one location. Your website just needs to handle a handful of orders each day. 
              In this case, a CMS like WordPress or Shopify—combined with an e-commerce plugin—is more than enough.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              But what if your bakery starts growing? You open more branches, and suddenly you're getting hundreds of orders during lunch rush. 
              At that point, performance becomes critical. Scaling with a CMS can be tricky and limiting. A custom-coded website, built specifically 
              for your business needs, is better equipped to handle high demand and complex workflows.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">🔒 2. Security: Who's Knocking at Your Door?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              If your business is attracting attention, it could also attract some unwanted guests—like hackers. CMS platforms are popular, 
              which means they're also popular targets for attacks. Vulnerabilities in third-party plugins can put your entire site at risk—and 
              as a developer, you're often stuck waiting for plugin authors to fix things.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              With custom development, we have full control over the security setup. We can build in protection specific to your business and 
              avoid relying on third-party code that could become a liability.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">⚡ 3. Performance: Is Your Site Slowing You Down?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              As your bakery grows, you might want to add features like loyalty programs, delivery tracking, or real-time inventory updates. 
              On a CMS, this usually means piling on more plugins. That can slow things down quickly, especially if the plugins aren't built 
              to work well together.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              Custom-coded sites are designed from the ground up for your needs—so they stay fast, efficient, and optimized as your business evolves.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">💰 4. Cost & Time: What's Your Budget and Timeline?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Let's be honest—building a website from scratch takes more time and costs more upfront. CMS platforms are faster to set up and 
              much more affordable initially, which makes them a solid choice for small businesses or startups.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              But if your business starts growing quickly, you might hit a wall and need to rebuild from scratch anyway. That's where custom 
              coding shines—it's built to grow with you. Plus, thanks to AI and automation, we're now able to cut custom development costs 
              and time by around 40% compared to a few years ago.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">👩‍💻 5. Tech Skills: Who's Managing the Site?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              One of the big advantages of CMS platforms is that you don't need to be a tech expert to use them. You can easily update content, 
              manage products, or write blog posts without touching a single line of code.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              Custom development, on the other hand, requires deeper technical knowledge—and usually a developer to handle changes or maintenance. 
              But with that comes much more flexibility and control.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">So... What's the Right Choice?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Here's the truth: there's no one-size-fits-all answer.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              If you're running a local bakery and just need to get online quickly, a CMS might be perfect. But if your business is growing fast, 
              or you're planning to expand in the near future, investing in custom development could save you a lot of time, money, and frustration 
              down the road.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">

              into your goals, your roadmap, and your customer journey to recommend the best fit—whether that's a CMS, custom code, or a smart mix of both.

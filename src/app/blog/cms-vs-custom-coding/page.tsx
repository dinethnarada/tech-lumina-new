              If you&apos;re a developer or even just someone building a website for your business you&apos;ve probably asked yourself this at some point:
              Should I go with a CMS (Content Management System) or build the site from scratch with custom code?
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              It&apos;s also one of the most common questions we get from clients at Tech Lumina. So, let&apos;s break it down in a way that&apos;s easy to understand. 
              To keep things simple, we&apos;ll use a bakery as an example and look at the key things you should consider before making your decision.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">üìà 1. Scalability: How Big Are You Planning to Grow?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Say you&apos;ve got a small, cozy bakery with one location. Your website just needs to handle a handful of orders each day. 
              In this case, a CMS like WordPress or Shopify combined with an e-commerce plugin is more than enough.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              But what if your bakery starts growing? You open more branches, and suddenly you&apos;re getting hundreds of orders during lunch rush. 
              At that point, performance becomes critical. Scaling with a CMS can be tricky and limiting. A custom-coded website, built specifically 
              for your business needs, is better equipped to handle high demand and complex workflows.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">üîí 2. Security: Who&apos;s Knocking at Your Door?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              If your business is attracting attention, it could also attract some unwanted guests like hackers. CMS platforms are popular, 
              which means they&apos;re also popular targets for attacks. Vulnerabilities in third-party plugins can put your entire site at risk and 
              as a developer, you&apos;re often stuck waiting for plugin authors to fix things.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              With custom development, we have full control over the security setup. We can build in protection specific to your business and 
              avoid relying on third-party code that could become a liability.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">‚ö° 3. Performance: Is Your Site Slowing You Down?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              As your bakery grows, you might want to add features like loyalty programs, delivery tracking, or real-time inventory updates. 
              On a CMS, this usually means piling on more plugins. That can slow things down quickly, especially if the plugins aren&apos;t built 
              to work well together.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              Custom-coded sites are designed from the ground up for your needs. So they stay fast, efficient, and optimized as your business evolves.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">üí∞ 4. Cost & Time: What&apos;s Your Budget and Timeline?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Let&apos;s be honest building a website from scratch takes more time and costs more upfront. CMS platforms are faster to set up and 
              much more affordable initially, which makes them a solid choice for small businesses or startups.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              But if your business starts growing quickly, you might hit a wall and need to rebuild from scratch. That&apos;s where custom coding shines. It&apos;s built to grow with you. Plus, thanks to AI and automation, we&apos;re now able to cut custom development costs and time by around 40% compared to a few years ago.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">üë©‚Äçüíª 5. Tech Skills: Who&apos;s Managing the Site?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              One of the big advantages of CMS platforms is that you don&apos;t need to be a tech expert to use them. You can easily update content, manage products, or write blog posts without touching a single line of code.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8">
              Custom development, on the other hand, requires deeper technical knowledge and usually a developer to handle changes or maintenance. 
              But with that comes much more flexibility and control.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">So... What&apos;s the Right Choice?</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Here&apos;s the truth: there&apos;s no one-size-fits-all answer.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              If you&apos;re running a local bakery and just need to get online quickly, a CMS might be perfect. But if your business is growing fast, 
              or you&apos;re planning to expand in the near future, investing in custom development could save you a lot of time, money, and frustration 
              down the road.
            </p>
